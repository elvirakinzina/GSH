## Description
Pipeline for identification for novel human Genomic Safe Harbor (GSH) sites.
The following criteria were used to computationally predict novel GSH:
- 50kb away from known genes
- 300kb away from known oncogenes
- 300kb away from microRNAs
- 150kb away from lncRNAs, tRNAs, centromeres, telomeres, genomic gaps
- 20kb away from enhancers

## Features
Produced genomic coordinates serve as comutationally predicted GSH sites for primary human T cells due to T cell specificity of the miRNA-seq data from ENCODE. These new sites were then shown to locate at a distance larger than 200kb from any miRNA stored in MirGeneDB.

## Prerequisites
- wig2bed and gtf2bed from BEDOPS https://bedops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/installation.html#installation
- bedtools https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/installation.html

## Data
- GENCODE annotation of the human genome version 24: comprehensive gene annotation, long non-coding RNA gene annotation, and predicted tRNA genes
https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/ 
- Cancer Gene Census (CGC) genes from tier 1 (extensive evidence of association with cancer available) and tier 2 (strong indications of the association exist) https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census
- miRNAseq of Homo sapiens naive thymus-derived CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cell male adult (29 years), ENCODE ENCSR113YFQ.
- microRNAs from MirGeneDB (based on Fromm et al, A Uniform System For The Annotation Of Human microRNA Genes And The Evolution Of The Human microRNAome. Annu Rev Genet. 2015, 49: 213â€“242) https://mirgenedb.org
- Genome sequence, GRCh38.p5 assembly
- Centromeric regions http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database/centromeres.txt.gz
- Gaps in the genome sequence which include telomeres http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database/gap.txt.gz

## Usage

Usage:
```bash
  ./predict_gsh.sh [-genes] [-oncogenes] [-micrornas] [-trnas] [-lncrnas] [-centromeres] [-gaps] [-dist_from_genes] [-dist_from_oncogenes] [-dist_from_micrornas] [-dist_from_trnas] [-dist_from_lncrnas] [-dist_from_centromeres] [-dist_from_gaps] [-h|--help]	
```
  
Options:
```bash
	-genes: Whether to exclude regions with and around genes (default=true)
	-oncogenes: Whether to exclude regions with and around oncogenes (default=true)
	-micrornas: Whether to exclude regions with and around microRNAs (default=true)
	-trnas: Whether to exclude regions with and around tRNAs (default=true)
	-lncrnas: Whether to exclude regions with and around lncRNAs (default=true)
	-centromeres: Whether to exclude regions with and around centromeres (default=true)
	-gaps: Whether to exclude regions with and around gaps (default=true)
	-dist_from_genes: Minimal distance from any safe harbor to any gene in bp (default=50000)
	-dist_from_oncogenes: Minimal distance from any safe harbor to any oncogene in bp (default=300000)
	-dist_from_micrornas: Minimal distance from any safe harbor to any microRNA in bp (default=300000)
	-dist_from_trnas: Minimal distance from any safe harbor to any tRNA in bp (default=0)
	-dist_from_lncrnas: Minimal distance from any safe harbor to any long-non-coding RNA in bp (default=0)
	-dist_from_centromeres: Minimal distance from any safe harbor to any centromere in bp (default=0)
	-dist_from_gaps: Minimal distance from any safe harbor to any gaps in bp (default=0)
	-h, --help: Prints help
 ```
 
Example:
```bash
./predict_gsh.sh -dist_from_trnas 0 -dist_from_gaps 0 -dist_from_centromeres 0 -enhancers false -dist_from_lncrnas 0
Distance from genes = 50000 bp
Distance from microRNAs = 300000 bp
Distance from tRNAs = 0 bp
Distance from lncRNAs = 0 bp
Distance from oncogenes = 300000 bp
Distance from centromeres = 0 bp
Distance from gaps = 0 bp
